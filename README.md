## Hints :

All of the javascript requirements can be found in the 'main.js' file.

On a side note, I was running late for my evening shift when I finished this assignment, so I duplicated the 4 images that I had downloaded instead of getting unique ones; I am pretty sure I've still implemented everything we've learned correectly though.
